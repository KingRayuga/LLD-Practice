# Splitwise Flow:

I go to splitwise, there I can choose to either add expense for group or I can choose to add expense for individual 
and after adding the expense the person involved in this gets some notification and then I can choose splitting strategy 
and I use simplify algo to simplify debs, feature to settle up/ give notification for settle up
